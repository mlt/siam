* Side Inlets Analysis Methods

SIAM is a specialized QGIS plugin with a collection of tools for
depressional terrain analysis.

So far it can only extract polygons corresponding to stage-area
curves.

While hypsometric curves can be derived with [[http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/hypsometry/][hypsometry plug-in]] and
polygons can be derived with [[http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/contour/][contour]], there are some differences:

- built with high vertical resolution in mind, e.g., 1cm stage step
  with 1m DEM, for rather flat terrain analysis
- extracted polygons must surround given set of points, i.e., it
  ignores same elevation areas in nearby depression
- support for parallel processing for independent locations from day 0
- heavily relies on PostGIS for data manipulation and parallel processing

While may not be useful for general public, it features the following
that may be of interest to other QGIS plugin developers:

- multiprocessing tested to be working on MS Windows
  - logging from sub-processes
- funneling logging to QGIS log console
- GUI persistence layer for QDialog entries
